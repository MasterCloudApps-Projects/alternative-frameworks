# Quarkus Project

This project works as GraphQL API Client that queries a GraphQL API Server and provides the data as REST API Server. It includes a Postman Collection to be tested. It also includes a Dynamic GraphQL API Client to preload data on App startUp that works diferent than GraphQL Static API. Precondition is that server must be running. To run, execute this:

```
quarkus dev
```

Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/

To run test:

```
quarkus dev test
```
